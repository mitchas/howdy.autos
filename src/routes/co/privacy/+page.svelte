		Howdy.autos's Privacy Policy was last updated and went into effect:
	</p>
	<div class="tag left red">October 8, 2023</div>


	<!-- Start of policy -->
	<h2 class="mtop-md">
		tl;dr:
		<small>It's very private.</small>
	</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>We only collect basic pageview tracking data. Not even enough to warrant one of those annoying cookie popups.</li>
			<li>Everything entered here is public and vieable by anyone else.</li>
			<li>We don't use any third-party tracking or analytics like Google or Meta Pixel. Our tracking is minimal and in-house.</li>

	<h3 class="mtop-md">
		Information we collect
	</h3>
	<p>
		We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.
	</p>
	<p>
		We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Now we'll go over what we collect.
	</p>


	<h4 class="mtop-sm">Information you provide to us</h4>
	<p>
		It's probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Basic Account Information</b>: Nothing. There are no accounts.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Content Information</b>: Depending on the Services you use, you may also provide us with information about you in other forms, such as making a public submission that includes said information. For example, if you leave a message, and add a line like "call my cell at 555-555-5555 to set up an appointment" somewhere on the page, then that information would be stored on our servers.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Communications With Us</b>: You may also provide us information when you contact support.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h4 class="mtop-md">Information we collect automatically</h4>
	<p>
		We also collect some things automatically.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Usage Information</b>: Howdy.autos collects data on traffic usage to help us understand how people are using the site. We only collect 1) the fact that you visited the site to monitor traffic volume, 2) the general location of the visitor (ie, 1 user in Minneapolis), 3) the page being viewed, and 4) Certain actions users complete (for testing, or to understand how features are used).</li>
		<li><b>Logs</b>: Our database automatically records actions performed on the database. Stuff like "User &lt;username&gt; with IP &lt;xxx.xxx...&gt; logged in at &lt;date&gt;", or "User &lt;username&gt; uploaded photo at &lt;date&gt;"</li>
	</ul>



	<h3 class="mtop-md">How And Why We Use Information</h3>
	<p>
		We use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes listed below:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>To provide our Services;</li>
		<li>To further develop and improve our Services;</li>
		<li>To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;</li>
		<li>To monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of Howdy.autos and others;</li>
		<li>To communicate with you, for example through an email, about changes or updates related to Howdy.autos, to solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date on Howdy.autos items you may find useful; and</li>
		<li>To personalize your experience using our Services, provide content recommendations, target our marketing messages to groups of our users, and serve relevant advertisements to some users.</li>
	</ul>


	<h3 class="mtop-md">Sharing Information</h3>
	<h4 class="mtop-md">How we share information</h4>
	<p>
		We do not sell our users' private personal information. We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Employees, and Independent Contractors</b>: We may disclose information about you to our employees and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We require our employees and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.</li>
		<li><b>Third Party Vendors</b>: We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you, those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like map & location providers), and companies that make products available on our websites, who may need information about you.</li>
		<li><b>Legal Requests</b>: We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.</li>
		<li><b>To Protect Rights, Property, and Others</b>: We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Howdy.autos, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</li>
		<li><b>Business Transfers</b>: In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Howdy.autos goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
		<li><b>With Your Consent</b>: We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction.</li>
		<li><b>Published Support Requests</b>: And if you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.</li>
	</ul>


	<h4 class="mtop-md">Information Shared Publicly</h4>
	<p>
		Information that you choose to make public is — as the word public implies — disclosed publicly. That means, of course, that information like public messages and any content included on it will be available to others. Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share.
	</p>


	<h3 class="mtop-md">
		How long we keep information
	</h3>
	<p>
		We generally discard information about you when we no longer need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it – which are described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information – and we are not legally required to continue to keep it.
	</p>

	<h3 class="mtop-md">
		Security 
	</h3>
	<p>
		While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as monitoring our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.
	</p>



	<!-- <h4>
		Controllers and Responsible Companies
	</h4>
	<p>
		Supabase is the controller (or co-controller) of personal information, which means that they are the company responsible for processing that information, based on the particular service and the location of the individual using our Services.
	</p> -->


	<h4 class="mtop-lg">How to reach us</h4>
	<p>
		If you have a question about this Privacy Policy, or you would like to contact us about any of the rights mentioned in the Your Rights section above, please email hello@hotdi.sh.
	</p>

	<h4 class="mtop-lg">Privacy Policy Changes</h4>
	<p>
		Although most changes are likely to be minor, Howdy.autos may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. Howdy.autos encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by updating the version number and date at the top of the page, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as adding a temporary banner to the website, or sending you a notification through email). Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy.
